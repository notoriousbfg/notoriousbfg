### Hello world!

Welcome to my Github profile. My name's Tim and I'm from the UK.

I'm a hacker, that is, I like to use programming to solve problems. In the past I've written lots of PHP and JavaScript but at the moment I'm most enjoying writing Go.

Some of the recent things I've worked on include:
- [runny](https://github.com/notoriousbfg/runny), the language I'm writing
- [backstab](https://github.com/notoriousbfg/backstab), a Firefox extension for blocking named websites
- [simple fantasy](https://github.com/notoriousbfg/simple-fantasy), a tool for helping you make your best fantasy FPL selection
- [filmlab](https://github.com/notoriousbfg/filmlab) for turning film negatives into positive images
- [transactions](https://github.com/notoriousbfg/transactions) (pending) for classifying bank transactions with custom rules
